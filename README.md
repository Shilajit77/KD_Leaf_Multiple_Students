# KD_Leaf_Multiple_Students
## Project: Leaf Disease Detection using knowledge Distillation
The main objective of this project is developing a deep learning model for leaf disease detection that can be trained faster with higher accuracy using transfer learning where we will involve teacher-student architecture. The teacher model will be trained on a large dataset and its knowledge will be transferred to smaller student model to improve the accuracy. Our aim is to make an ensemble of student model which has learned from the teacher model
